# BeautyBoost
In Indonesia there are still a lot of people who don't pay attention to their health, especially their faces. There are still many people whose faces have acne and acne scars, possibly due to poor pollution in Indonesia, irregular eating and sleeping patterns, and possibly also because of the weather. In the last few years, there have been many domestically made skincare products and many people use these skincare products, especially young people. However, there are still many who have not used such products, perhaps because of ignorance and the high price. BeautyBoost aim to create an acne detection application, an innovative solution that aims to make Indonesian people pay attention and care for their facial health. This application functions as a health tool that allows users to identify the type of acne and the solution to the acne problem.
